# Complementary-DNA
In DNA strings, symbols "A" and "T" are complements of each other, as "C" and "G". Your function receives one side of the DNA (string, except for Haskell); you need to return the other complementary side. DNA strand is never empty or there is no DNA at all (again, except for Haskell) (input --> output)  "ATTGC" --> "TAACG" "GTAT" --> "CATA"
